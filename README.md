#Scale - Simulator Engine

Scale is a distributed graphic rendering and simulation tool for aerospace engineering and military applications. Scale was initially create to render and observe impact debris scenarios.  The project is currently being migrated over to the open source community where it will reside for future reference and contributions for those interested in the simulation sector. Work is currently under way to migrate the development environment to Eclipse CDT for ease of use and multiplatform compatibility.
