#Scale - Simulator Engine

Scale is a distributed graphic rendering and simulation tool for aerospace engineering and military applications. Scale was initially created to render and observe impact debris scenarios using the Kinetic Impact Debris Distribution (KIDD) model. Eventually we decided to open source portions of the simulation codebase, but for licensing reasons we had to remove the KIDD model.
